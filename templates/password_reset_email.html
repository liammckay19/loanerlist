Hi there,<br>
<br>
Someone asked for password reset for email {{ email }}. Follow the link below:<br>
{{ protocol}}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}<br>
<br>
In case you forgot your username: {{ user.username }}<br>
<br>
If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL in a new browser window instead.<br>
<br>
If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered your email address by mistake while trying<br>
to reset a password. If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely<br>
disregard this email.<br>
